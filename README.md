## Project Overview

Tour-Zen is an innovative tourism management system that leverages Artificial Intelligence to address the challenges of modern tourism, such as overcrowding, environmental impact, and uneven distribution of tourist activity[cite: 1613, 1614]. By providing intelligent solutions for both travelers and tourism authorities, Tour-Zen aims to create a more sustainable and enjoyable travel experience for everyone[cite: 1604].

The platform uses AI to predict tourist demand, offer personalized itineraries, manage crowds in real-time, and promote eco-friendly travel options[cite: 1604, 1605, 1635, 1638].

## Features

* **AI-Driven Recommendations:** Personalized travel itineraries based on user preferences, predicted crowd levels, and sustainability goals[cite: 1635].
* **Real-Time Crowd Monitoring:** Live updates on crowd density at popular destinations to help travelers avoid congestion[cite: 1636].
* **Sustainable Tourism Promotion:** Encourages eco-friendly travel choices through carbon-footprint calculations and dynamic pricing[cite: 1638].
* **Dynamic Pricing:** Travel costs adjusted based on demand to incentivize off-peak travel and distribute tourist flow[cite: 1607, 1608].
* **Support for Underdeveloped Locations:** Promotes lesser-known destinations to distribute economic benefits and reduce pressure on popular sites[cite: 1606].
